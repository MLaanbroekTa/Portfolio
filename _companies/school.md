I followed the 4 year Indie game dev program at Buas at the time also called (NHTV)
Classes ranged from Art, Programming, management to design. It is here I got introduced to Houdini and tech art.
After the bachelors I took the opportunity to follow the new Masters program that was just created.
Further diving into to Art and Tech art.

See below some projects and assignments.
