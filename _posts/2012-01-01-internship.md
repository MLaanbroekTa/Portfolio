The second project I worked on this project during my work placement at BlewScreen. It is an interactive lighting installation located in the Pius haven, Tilburg. The installation tracks the number and direction of people crossing the bridge. When a given amount of people have crossed the bridge a short light animation is played.

For this project I helped design the system that controls the animations. Together with the design I build the user interface for the maintenance screen and several basic animation tools that artist can use to create animations within unity. These tools allow for movement, random creation and others options but they also react on the number of people going over the bridge and their direction. This allowed for animations that change depending on the number of people going in each direction.
