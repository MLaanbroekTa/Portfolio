## Colour nodes Houdini shelf tool
This is a Houdini shelf tool created where users can insert node names and link a Colour to it. When applied all nodes in the project matching to any of the given names is given a color linked to that name. This can be used for example if you want to give all Null nodes the same Colour without having to manually find and change them
