A Simple looking but slightly complex tool. The system takes in premade wall modules of different sizes, slopes and bend direction and angles on top having to handle towers and gates placement Either automatically when intersecting with roads or at an given interval in case of the towers.
The main difficulty lies in taking a drawn curve created by an Artist and converting it to a spline with a limited number of predefined angles and segment lengths. On top of following any number of other contains. Like snaping to terrain without gaps, placing towers at a predefined interval.

With limits on slopes, there are situations where the wall cannot follow the terrain or the spline. In these cases a warning mesh is returned to show artist that a section needs some adjustment.
