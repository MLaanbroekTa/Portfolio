To put everything learned about materials in practice its best to combined it all in a personal project. Starting with some simple materials.
The aim was to implement an interesting feature in each material to experiment with possibilities.

The buildings are a single Unreal level instance created by combining multiple actors.

## Stucco and brick layerd
A modified version of a tutorial. The main goal was to have the material work on a large group of actors. In such a way that only the bottom meshes get an eroded edge near the bottom.
This was an artist can make copies of the level instance and place them at any height while keeping the effect.
This is achieved by using the object component position. This defaults to bottom of the building when combined with Level instance.

## Stone
A simple distance-based fade for the normal. Inspired by the default material of Unreal.

## Metal sheeting
Similar to the Stucco and brick. But instead of component location the world position is used to add an extra optional layer of rust the sheeting.
Giving more varied look.
