A game created during a 48 hour Game Jam with the theme “UP”. The goal of the game is get the best high score by getting as high as possible in the tree and while collecting carrots. It’s a 2 player game but only one player can get the high score. So besides jumping the player can also kick his fellow player throwing him of the leaves.

For this project I created the characters models, textures, rigs and animations for both the players and the enemy animals.
