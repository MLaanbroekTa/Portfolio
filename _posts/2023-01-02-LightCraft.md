Lightspeed procedural pipeline utilising Usd and Nvidia Omniverse.
My work was to advise and provide feedback on the system being developed.
Looking at the Houdini and USD side but also testing and experimenting with the Blueprint interface.

Additional work was on the creation of the building blocks tool for the demo. Making use of the data generated by the Road system as input and outputting data for the building generator.
Making use of all the features of the pipeline and showing a potential work flow.

See video for more details on the pipeline.
